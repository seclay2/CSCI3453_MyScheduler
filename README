*  Description of the program
*******************************************************

This C++ program implements a simulation of running various
CPU scheduling algorithms from a list of processes in an input
file.

*******************************************************
*  Source files
*******************************************************

main.cpp
   Main driver program.
   Runs a simulation of a specified scheduling algorithm and outputs
   a table of processes, along with

Process.h
    Struct Process defines a basic process unit that contains process
    attributes and helper functions.

TableTools.h
    TableTools namespace of various table formatting
    tools.

CPU.cpp/h
    Class CPU defines a virtual CPU object that runs a process given to it.
    Function declarations and documentation in CPU.h

Scheduler.cpp/h
    Class Scheduler defines a basic Scheduler object that schedules processes
    from a list of processes from an input file.
    Object also contains list of processes and statistics from scheduling.
    Function declarations and documentation in Scheduler.h

FCFS.cpp/h
    Class FCFS defines a derivative class of Scheduler that implements a
    First-Come-First-Serve scheduling algorithm.
    Function declarations and documentation in FCFS.h

SRTF.cpp/h
    Class SRTF defines a derivative class of Scheduler that implements a
    Shortest-Remaining-Time-First scheduling algorithm.
    Function declarations and documentation in SRTF.h

RR.cpp/h
    Class RR defines a derivative class of Scheduler that implements a
    Round-Robin scheduling algorithm.
    Function declarations and documentation in RR.h

   
*******************************************************
*  Circumstances of programs
*******************************************************

   The program runs successfully.  
   
   The program was developed and tested on gcc Apple LLVM version
   10.0.1.  It was compiled, run, and tested on gcc csegrid.ucdenver.pvt.


*******************************************************
*  How to build and run the program
*******************************************************

1. Build the program.

    Change to the directory that contains the file by:
    % cd Scott_Clay_Lab3/

    Compile the program by:
    % make

2. Run the program by:
   % ./myscheduler <input_file> <scheduling_algorithm> <quantum_size>

   input_file is file of process list
   scheduling_algorithm is desired scheduling algorithm initialization ( FCFS, SRTF, RR )
   quantum_size is optional time quantum size for use with RR algorithm, default quantum_size is 3

3. Delete executables by
   % ./make clean
